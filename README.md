# RandomForest_ML
Data Preparation:
Begin by preparing your dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model Initialization:
Initialize the Random Forest classifier, specifying parameters such as the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) and other optional settings.

Training the model and Make Prediction:
By train the model on Training set and by use the train model to predict the test data set.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tuning Hyperparameters:
Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
